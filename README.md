## ServiceStack Xcode Plugin

ServiceStack's **Add ServiceStack Reference** feature lets iOS/OSX developers generate an native typed Swift 2.0 API for your ServiceStack Services directly from within XCode using the new [ServiceStack XCode Plugin](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Swift/raw/master/dist/ServiceStackXcode.dmg) - providing a simpler, cleaner and more versatile alternative to WCF's Add Service Reference feature that reduces the burden and effort required for consuming ServiceStack Services whilst benefiting from Swift's strong-typing feedback: 

## Download ServiceStack Xcode Plugin

[![ServiceStackXCode.dmg download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/servicestackxcode-dmg.png)](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Swift/raw/master/dist/ServiceStackXcode.dmg)

The ServiceStack XCode Plugin can be installed by dragging it to the XCode Plugins directory:

Once installed, developers can easily add a reference to a remote ServiceStack instance and update its typed DTO's using the new Menu options in XCode's Main Menu:

### [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference)

![XCode Add Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/xcode-add-reference.png)

Use the **Add ServiceStack Reference** Menu option to bring up the Add Reference XCode UI Sheet, which just like the Popup Window in VS.NET just needs the Url for your remote ServiceStack instance and the name of the file the generated Swift DTO's should be saved to:

![XCode Add Reference Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/xcode-add-reference-sheet.png)

After clicking **Add Reference**, 2 files will be added to your XCode project yielding an instant typed API:

 - `JsonServiceClient.swift` - A Swift JSON ServiceClient with API's based on that of [the .NET JsonServiceClient](/csharp-client)
 - `{FileName}.dtos.swift` - Your Services DTO Types converted in Swift

### Update ServiceStack Reference

You can also customize how the Swift types are generated by uncommenting the desired option with the behavior you want, then click the **Update ServiceStack Reference** Main Menu item to fetch the latest DTO's with the updated options as seen below:
